# Artifacts Reference

Artifacts are the core document units in the SuperSpec workflow. This document provides detailed information about each artifact's purpose and structure.

## Artifact Overview

| Artifact | Mode | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| proposal.md | Standard/Boost | Change proposal (Standard: requirements + tech solution; Boost: requirements background) |
| spec.md | Boost | Requirement details + interactions (US/FR/AC) |
| design.md | Boost | Design document (optional, auto-detected) |
| tasks.md | Standard/Boost | Task checklist |
| checklist.md | Standard/Boost | Quality gate (Standard: /10 after proposal; Boost: /25 after spec) |
| clarify.md | Standard/Boost | Clarification record |
| context.md | Auto-generated | Context restoration |

## Standard Mode vs Boost Mode

CLI `superspec create` only creates folder + git branch. AI generates artifacts on demand via /ss-create.

### Standard Mode

```
superspec/changes/<name>/
├── proposal.md     # AI generates (requirements + technical solution)
├── checklist.md    # AI generates (quality gate /10)
├── tasks.md        # AI generates via /ss-tasks
└── clarify.md     # On demand
```

### Boost Mode

```
superspec/changes/<name>/
├── proposal.md     # AI generates (requirements background)
├── spec.md         # AI generates (requirement details + interactions)
├── design.md       # AI generates when needed (optional)
├── checklist.md    # AI generates (quality gate /25)
├── tasks.md        # AI generates via /ss-tasks
└── clarify.md     # On demand
```

## proposal.md

### Purpose

**Standard**: Requirements + technical solution (self-contained, ready to split tasks).

**Boost**: Requirements background describing:
- Goals, Non-Goals
- Impact and Risks
- Solution Overview

### When to Use

- Starting a new feature or fix
- Defining change scope
- Getting team buy-in

### Best Practices

**Do:**
- Clearly describe the problem
- Define measurable success criteria
- List key trade-offs

**Avoid:**
- Excessive implementation details
- Lengthy background introductions
- Vague success criteria

---

## spec.md (Boost Mode)

### Purpose

Requirement details + interactions, providing:
- User Stories (US)
- Functional Requirements (FR)
- Acceptance Criteria (AC)

### Structure

```
User Stories (US)
├── US-1: ...
├── US-2: ...
└── ...

Functional Requirements (FR)
├── FR-1: ... (related to US-1)
├── FR-2: ... (related to US-1, US-2)
└── ...

Acceptance Criteria (AC)
├── AC-1: ... (related to FR-1)
├── AC-2: ... (related to FR-2)
└── ...
```

### Cross-References

Each element should have clear reference relationships:

```
US-1 ←→ FR-1, FR-2 ←→ AC-1, AC-2
```

Use `validate --check-deps` to verify reference integrity.

---

## design.md (Boost Mode, Optional)

### Purpose

Technical design document (auto-generated when cross-system or major architecture), including:
- Architecture overview
- Component design
- Data model
- API design
- Technology choices

### When to Use

- Complex features requiring design review
- Introducing new technologies or patterns
- Cross-team collaboration

### Best Practices

**Do:**
- Use diagrams to illustrate architecture
- Define interfaces in detail
- Document technology choice reasoning

**Avoid:**
- Copying spec content
- Overly detailed implementation code
- Ignoring non-functional requirements

---

## tasks.md

### Purpose

Task checklist that breaks specs into executable tasks:
- Organized by phases
- Each task < 1 hour
- Parallel tasks marked

### Task Granularity

Each task should:
- Be independently completable
- Have clear completion criteria
- Take < 1 hour

### Parallel Marker

Use `[P]` to mark tasks that can run in parallel:

```markdown
### Task 1: Create database model
### Task 2: Create API routes [P]
### Task 3: Create frontend components [P]
### Task 4: Integration tests
```

Tasks 2 and 3 can be executed in parallel with Task 1.

---

## checklist.md (Both Modes)

### Purpose

Quality gates ensuring changes meet quality standards. Standard: /10 after proposal. Boost: /25 after spec. Auto-invoked during /ss-create, also callable manually.
- Code quality
- Test coverage
- Security checks
- Performance requirements
- Documentation completeness

### When to Use

- Run `/ss-checklist` before `apply`
- Ensure all items pass before archiving

---

## clarify.md

### Purpose

Record requirement clarifications and design decisions:
- Questions raised
- Discussion process
- Final decisions
- Decision reasoning

### When to Use

- When requirements are unclear
- When multiple implementation approaches exist
- When important decisions need to be recorded

---

## context.md (Auto-generated)

### Purpose

Auto-generated by the `sync` command for Vibe Coding:
- Change overview
- Current progress
- Git diff
- Pending tasks

### When Generated

- Running `superspec sync`
- Running `/ss-resume` (auto-triggers sync)

### Do Not Edit Manually

`context.md` is regenerated on each sync; manual edits will be overwritten.

---

## Artifact Status

Each artifact has a status defined in its frontmatter:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `draft` | Draft, not yet complete |
| `ready` | Ready, content complete |
| `done` | Done, validated |

```yaml
---
name: add-user-auth
status: ready
---
```

Use `superspec status` to view all artifact statuses.

---

## Size Limits

To optimize AI context windows, each artifact has size limits:

| Limit | Default |
|-------|---------|
| Target | 300 lines |
| Hard limit | 400 lines |

Use `superspec lint` to check for violations.

### Handling Violations

1. **Trim content**: Remove non-essential information
2. **Split changes**: Break large changes into multiple smaller ones
3. **Use references**: Reference external documents instead of inlining
