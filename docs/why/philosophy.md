# Philosophy

SuperSpec is built on core principles derived from observing AI-assisted development practices.

## Spec-First

### Principle

> In the AI era, specifications matter more than code.

Code can be quickly generated by AI, but **correct specifications** ensure correct code.

### Practice

```
Traditional: Requirements → Code → Docs (often skipped)
SuperSpec:   Requirements → Spec → Code (docs included)
```

### Why It Works

1. **Reduce ambiguity** - Structured specs eliminate misunderstanding
2. **Verifiable** - Clear acceptance criteria
3. **Traceable** - Complete chain from requirements to code

## Context Economy

### Principle

> AI context window is a scarce resource that must be used efficiently.

### Practice

| Constraint | Rule | Reason |
|------------|------|--------|
| File size | ≤ 300 lines | Fits context window |
| File count | Minimize | Reduce switching |
| Content density | High information | Avoid redundancy |

### Why 300 Lines

```
Typical AI context: 8K-128K tokens
Optimal file size: 300 lines ≈ 1.5K tokens
Leaves room for: Chat history + code generation + tool output
```

## Dual-Mode Workflow

### Principle

> Different tasks need different levels of specification.

### Practice

**Standard Mode** - Quick iteration
- For: Bug fixes, small features, prototypes
- Artifacts: proposal.md + tasks.md
- Time: Minutes

**Boost Mode** - Complete specification
- For: Complex features, reviews, collaboration
- Artifacts: + spec.md + design.md + checklist.md
- Time: Hours

### Selection Guide

```
Feature Complexity
    │
    ├─ Low ──→ Standard Mode
    │
    ├─ Medium ──→ Standard + manual additions
    │
    └─ High ──→ Boost Mode
```

## Progressive Adoption

### Principle

> Tools should adapt to teams, not teams to tools.

### Practice

**Level 0: Proposal only**
```bash
superspec create myFeature
# Just use proposal.md to capture ideas
```

**Level 1: + Tasks**
```bash
/ss-tasks
# Add task tracking
```

**Level 2: Complete workflow**
```bash
superspec create myFeature -b
# Use boost mode, full process
```

**Level 3: Team collaboration**
```bash
# Configure team templates
# Integrate CI/CD
# Automate checks
```

## In-Context Learning Support

### Principle

> Cross-session context continuity is key to AI development.

### Problem

```
Session 1: Implemented user auth
Session 2: AI doesn't know about Session 1
Session 3: Repeating explanations...
```

### Solution

```bash
# End of session
superspec sync        # Save git changes to context.md

# Start of session
/ss-resume           # AI reads context.md, restores context
```

### How It Works

```
context.md = git diff + git status + current task status
```

AI reads context.md to quickly understand:
- Current project state
- Completed work
- Pending tasks

## Local-First

### Principle

> All data should be stored in the project, version controlled with code.

### Practice

```
project/
├── .superspec/           # All SuperSpec data
│   ├── changes/          # Change records
│   └── archive/          # Historical archives
├── src/                  # Source code
└── .git/                 # Version control
```

### Benefits

1. **Privacy** - Data never leaves local
2. **Version Control** - Managed with code
3. **Portable** - Project contains all info
4. **Offline** - No network required

## Summary

SuperSpec's philosophy:

```
Spec-First + Context Economy + Dual-Mode + Progressive + In-Context Learning + Local-First
```

Together forming a toolkit **optimized for AI-assisted development**.
